About me
======
I received my Bachelor of Economics from Beihang University in 2025, majoring in Economic Statistics. My research interests lie in FinTech, Machine Learning, and Data Science.

I am currently applying for PhD positions and am available to start in Spring 2026 or even Fall 2026, though I would be particularly interested in any remaining Fall 2025 vacancies (should such opportunities still exist).

Driven by a strong passion for academia, I possess exceptional self-motivation and a proven ability to master new concepts quickly. With an optimistic and proactive attitude, I am committed to bringing fresh perspectives and positive energy to the research team. I hope to earn your consideration for potential openings.
